# LithRageTexUnpacker
This tool takes in a texture file stored .BIN format used on Monolith Productions' RAGE engine, primarily used on the Microsoft Windows 95 Game Sampler and Game Sampler 2 CDs, and converts it into a PNG file.

## Requirements
.NET 8.0

## Usage
Compile the EXE, and run it from command line with the BIN file as the first argument and the GLOBAL.PAL file you've extracted from your .REZ file (like ODYSSEY.REZ for Game Sampler 2) as the second argument.
